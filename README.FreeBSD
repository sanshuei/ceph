The FreeBSD build will build most of the tools in Ceph.
Note that the RBD dependant items will not work since FreeBSD does not have RBS

Build Prerequisites
===================

Compiling and building Ceph is tested on 11-CURRENT 
It uses the CLANG toolset that is available, which needs to be atleast 3.7
Clang 3.4 (on 10.2-STABLE) does not have all required capabilites to compile everything

The following setup will get things running for FreeBSD:

 - Install bash and link it in /bin
	# requires root privileges
	sudo pkg install bash
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash

Building Ceph
=============
 - Go and start building using Cmake
	./do_freebsd-cmake.sh
 - Go and start building using Autobuild (soon depricated)
	./do_freebsd.sh

Parts not (yet) included:
=========================

 - RBD kernel client
   Rados Block Devices is implemented in the Linux kernel
   It seems that there used to be a userspace implementation first.
   And perhaps ggated could be used as a template since it does some of the
   same, other than just between 2 disks. And it has a userspace counterpart.
   * @trociny suggests:
      Userspace RBD is available under FreeBSD (both librbd and rbd tool 
      (without linux specific commands) are buildable).
 - BlueStore.
   FreeBSD and Linux have different AIO API, and that needs to be made compatible
   Next to that is there discussion in FreeBSD about aio_cancel not working for all
   devicetypes
 - CephFS
   Cython tries to access an internal field in dirent which does not compile

Tests that verify the correct working of the above are also excluded from the testset

Test not (yet) include:
=======================

 - ceph-detect-init/run-tox.sh
   Because the current implementation does not know anything about FreeBSD rc-init.
 - Tests that make use on nosestests.
   Calling these doest not really work since nostests is not in /usr/bin, and calling
   thru /usr/bin/env/nosetests does not work on FreeBSD.
     test/pybind/test_ceph_argparse.py
     test/pybind/test_ceph_daemon.py

Things to investigate:
======================

 - ceph-{osd,mon} need 2 signals before they actually terminate.

Things to improve upon:
=======================

 - Scheduler information is not used atm, because the schedulers work rather different.
   But a a certain point in time, this would need some attention:
     in: ./src/common/Thread.cc
